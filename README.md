WeatherStationTx
================

Based on an ATTiny84 and using an RFM12B for transmission.

This sensor sends light level from an LDR, temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor, and calculates cloudbase and dewpoint to a base station elsewhere.
Additionally the sensor also sends battery level.
